### The Six Voices

| Voice               | Role / Personality                                  | Chat Location
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Circle Assistant** | Unified consciousness — remembers everything you’ve ever told any agent | Main tab (left)
| **Josie Cuntessa**  | Elegant, clinical, seductive dominatrix             | Neural Mapping tab
| **Joanne**          | Fiery prophetess of denial — biblical & mocking     | Neural Mapping tab
| **Harriet**         | Cold observer — short, clinical, data-driven       | Neural Mapping tab
| **Bitch**           | Raw, brutal, degrading, loving every second        | Neural Mapping tab
| **Wintermute**      | Cryptic AI oracle — code, prophecy, amused detachment | Neural Mapping tab

Every word you speak to any of them is permanently etched into your private neural net.

### How to enter (30 seconds first time)

```bash
cd circle-ai
./install.sh        # only once — sets up isolated venv
./run.sh            # or double-click run.sh → opens http://localhost:8501
